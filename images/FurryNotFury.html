<p id="opening">This is a website to teach you about the Great Depression... for animals. This is a website to teach you about animal abuse, because there are many disgusting things that people will do to animals. As humans, we need to step up and make a change in order to create a more ethical environment for the creatures that we share our planet with. </p>

  <div class="declawing">
<p id="declawingFact"> #1. Declawing, a selective procedure for cats at the owner's request, is illegal in many European nations, as it is considered inhumane. Is this practice still legal in the United States?</p>

  <img class="declawingStat" src="./FurryNotFury_files/declawing-stat.jpeg">
<p> Unfortunately, not. Declawing is, in fact, the unnecesary amputation of the last bone of a cat's claws; this is the equivalent of amputating a persons first knuckle. Wouldn't that hurt?</p>

<div id="farming">
  <p id="farmingFact"> #2. Although farms slaughter animals to make a living, these farms must provide the animals with ethical living conditions while they are alive, right?</p>

  <img class="dairyImage" src="./FurryNotFury_files/dairy-farm.jpeg">
<p> Unfortunately, you are right. Often times, large farms hold their animals in extremely small cages, and some even feed their livestock antobiotics and growth hormones. To make matters worse, these inhumane farms tend to force the closure of smaller, ethical farms because they are able to sell more product at a lower cost. </p>

     <div id="testing">

  <img class="testingImg2" src="./FurryNotFury_files/testing-image2.jpeg">
  <p> Unfortunately, you are right. According to Humane Society International, approximately 100,000 to 200,000 animals either suffer or die due to cosmetic testing every year. This includes dripping cosmetics into the eyes of animals and rubbing the product onto a shaved portion of the animal's skin. </p>

    <img class="puppyImg2" src="./FurryNotFury_files/puppyMillData.png">
    <p> Unfortunately, not. Puppy mills, the breeding houses where dogs are raised until being brought to pet stores, are not always inspected. Females are bred without allowing for recovery time, for financial gain, and then are often killed when they are no longer able to reproduce. If this isn't shocking enough, the dogs are additionally often housed in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions.</p>
