      <li>My favorite foods include bananas, strawberries, and cereal.</li>
      <li>If I could be any animal, I would probably want to be a penguin.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Key Learning: I couldn't have taken such risks without my teammates, who always had hope that we would be able to accomplish a difficult task!</p>

    <p>Advice: If you are skeptical about studying computer science, just remember that you can do anything you put your mind to, no matter what it is! You can accomplish truly anything with enough hardwork!</p>
