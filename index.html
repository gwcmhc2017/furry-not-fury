<div class="declawing">
<p id='declawingFact'> #1. Declawing, a selective procedure for cats at the owner's request, is illegal in many European nations, as it is considered inhumane. Is this practice still legal in the United States?</p>
    <button id="yes1">Yes</button>
      <button id="no1">No</button>
</div>

<div id='declawingAnswer1'>
  <img class='declawingStat' src="images/declawing-stat.jpeg"/>
<p> Unfortunately, not. Declawing is, in fact, the unnecesary amputation of the last bone of a cat's claws; this is the equivalent of amputating a persons first knuckle. Wouldn't that hurt?</p>

<div id='farming'>
  <p id='farmingFact'> #2. Although farms slaughter animals to make a living, these farms must provide the animals with ethical living conditions while they are alive, right?
    <button id="yes2">Yes</button>
      <button id="no2">No</button>
</div>

<div id='farmingAnswer1'>
  <img class='dairyImage' src="images/dairy-farm.jpeg"/>
<p> Unfortunately, you are right. Often times, large farms hold their animals in extremely small cages, and some even feed their livestock antobiotics and growth hormones. To make matters worse, these inhumane farms tend to force the closure of smaller, ethical farms because they are able to sell more product at a lower cost. </p>

     <div id='testing'>
       <p id='testingFact'> #3. With many cosmetic companies such as Lush and Urban Decay becoming cruelty-free, can it officially be said that testing on animals has ended in the cosmetic industry?</p>
       <button id="yes3">Yes</button>
         <button id="no3">No</button>
     </div>

  <div id='testingAnswer1'>
  <img class='testingImg2' src='images/testing-image2.jpeg'/>
  <p> Unfortunately, you are right. According to Humane Society International, approximately 100,000 to 200,000 animals either suffer or die due to cosmetic testing every year. This includes dripping cosmetics into the eyes of animals and rubbing the product onto a shaved portion of the animal's skin. </p>

    <div id='puppyMills'>
  <p id='puppyMillsFact'> #4. The puppies in the local pet store are so adorable! They must be raised in loving homes with great conditions before being brought to the pet store, right?</p>
  <button id="yes4">Yes</button>
    <button id="no4">No</button>
  </div>


    <div id='puppyAnswer1'>
    <img class='puppyImg2' src='images/puppyMillData.png'/>
    <p> Unfortunately, not. Puppy mills, the breeding houses where dogs are raised until being brought to pet stores, are not always inspected. Females are bred without allowing for recovery time, for financial gain, and then are often killed when they are no longer able to reproduce. If this isn't shocking enough, the dogs are additionally often housed in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions.</p>
